Final Project for my Advanced GIS Applications class.

I analyzed all Divvy bike stations in the city of chicago to understand:
- What is the distribution of Divvy bike stations across the city?
- How do demographic factors influence Divvy station locations?
- Where the city can use more Divvy stations?
- How accessible are Divvy bike stations in different parts of the city?

To answer these questions, I ran these models:
- Optimized hot spot analysis
- Optimized outlier analysis
- Geographically weighted regression
- Buffer analysis
- Network analysis
